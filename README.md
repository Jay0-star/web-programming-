actually we are going to learn django very smoothly and it is mainly taught by our anish sir and the youtube channel named code aur chai

we have to understand that for the fast working we have to use uv here 
to make the virtual environment for django we have to type the python -m venv but if you have the package manager as uv then you have to type the uv venv

in the windows you have to type the .venv/scripts/activate
